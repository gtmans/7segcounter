# 7segcounter
Learning by doing and having some fun with 7 segment display and CD 4026 BE chip.
I saw this 1st video but there was not enough information to it yourselve. So I used 4 articles to make this counter and to learn how 7 segment dispay and CD 4026 BE chip work:<BR>
https://fb.watch/ma2sz8u3RB/ instruction video missing how to wire the display itself<BR>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-OUxG2VBi0 using 7-seg display with other (strange) pinout<BR>
https://www.petervis.com/GCSE_Design_and_Technology_Electronic_Products/4026-counter-circuits/4026-counter-circuit.html complete wire layout, pinout and explanations, resistor value explanation and use 7 seg CC (common cathode)<BR>
https://components101.com/displays/7-segment-display-pinout-working-datasheet 7-seg led explanation of names of segment parts<BR><BR>

This is the secret schematic (chip is CD4026BE and not 74HC595 as on picture) resistors 7x220 and 2x1k ohms, capacitor 0,22uF <BR>
